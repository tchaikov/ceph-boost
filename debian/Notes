	Built Libraries
	---------------

date_time	static	shared
filesystem	static	-
graph		static 	shared
python		[1]	shared
regex		static	shared
signals		static	shared
test    	static	shared
thread		-	shared (comprises 3 libraries)

The static-only libs are incorporated into boost-dev
package.

[1] built but not useful, thus not distributed.


	Thread Support
	--------------

All debian libraries are supposed to be built with _REENTRANT
defined (policy 10.2).  For the jam-built libraries, use
"<define>_REENTRANT" on command line in debian/rules.  For
graph library, set in Makefile.


	Changes to Upstream Sources
	---------------------------

* boost/detail/limits.hpp
  - use <endian.h>

* boost/math/quaternion.hpp
  - patch in bug #199270. 

* boost/python/converter/as_to_python_function.hpp
  - patch in bug #192481.

* boost/python/object/make_ptr_instance.hpp
  - patch in bug #198524.

* libs/graph/src/Makefile
  - build using optimization and no debugging
  - set -DYYSTYPE_IS_DECLARED=1

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_lex.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_lex.cpp
  - generated by different flex version.

* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.c
* tools/build/jam_src/jamgram.h
  - generated by different bison version.

* libs/graph/src/graphviz_digraph_parser.cpp
* libs/graph/src/graphviz_graph_parser.cpp
  - insert std:: qualifier.


	STLPort and GCC 3
	-----------------

Boost built using GCC 3 passes the regression testing.  This is
the default GCC now, so stlport is no longer used.


	Documentation
	-------------

Generate the list of documentation files using wget going through
localhost to get the source tree

    wget -r --no-parent --domains=localhost \
	http://localhost/lsrc/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/index.htm
    cd localhost/....
    rm -rf boost
    for f in `find * -type f`; do 
	test -f /usr/local/src/devel/boost/boost-cvs-local/$f && echo $f; 
    done > documentation-files

* need to symlink .../HTML/boost to /usr/include/boost; when put the symlink
  into the deb, it got converted to a directory during installation; use
  postinst script to do it

* use -Nlibboost-doc with dh_compress to inhibit compressing files in the HTML
  tree
