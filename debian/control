Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides headers for all Boost libraries.
 .
 Extended precision arithmetic package libmpfrc++-dev or libntl-dev is
 required to use the Boost.Multiprecision wrapping of the respective
 library.

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and
 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering

 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic duration
    class.Examples of time durations include days, minutes, seconds and
    nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number of clock
    ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are united with
    a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
    represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
    epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a particular
    platform: system_clock, steady_clock and high_resolution_clock. A
    clock is a pairing of a time_point and duration, and a function
    which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time spent by the current
    process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures system-CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * a tuple-like class process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU,
    and system-CPU process times together.
  * a thread_clock thread steady clock giving the time spent by the
    current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 .
 Boost.Container library implements several well-known containers,

 advanced features not present in standard containers or to offer the
 latest standard draft features for compilers that don't comply with
 the latest C++ standard.
 .

 .
  * Move semantics are implemented, including move emulation
    for pre-C++11 compilers.
  * New advanced features (e.g. placement insertion,
    recursive containers) are present.
  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in
      replacements for standard associative containers but more
      memory friendly and with faster searches.
    * stable_vector: a std::list and std::vector hybrid container:
      vector-like random-access iterators and list-like iterator
      stability in insertions and erasures.
    * slist: the classic pre-standard singly linked list implementation
      offering constant-time size(). Note that C++11 forward_list has no size().

Description: cooperatively-scheduled micro-/userland-threads
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)
 scheduled cooperatively.  The API contains classes and functions to
 manage and synchronize fibers similarly to standard thread support
 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining

 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

 system CPU process time. Class auto_cpu_timer is a refinement of
 cpu_timer that automatically reports the elapsed times when an
 auto_cpu_timer object is destroyed.

Description: C++ runtime polymorphism based on concepts
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 C++ has two distinct kinds of polymorphism, virtual functions and templates,
 each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages.  The Boost.TypeErasure
 library combines the superior abstraction capabilities of templates, with the
 runtime flexibility of virtual functions.

Description: C99/C++ preprocessor library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Wave C++ preprocessor library is a Standards conformant
 implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality
 packed behind a simple to use interface, which integrates well with
 the well known idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL).
